### Authentication Flow (Demo)
1. User enters university email and password
2. Email domain is validated against allowed domains
3. Password is checked for minimum length
4. User object is created and stored in localStorage
5. User is redirected to marketplace

**Note:** This is a demo authentication system. In a production app, authentication would be handled server-side with proper security measures.

### Data Persistence (Demo)
- User authentication state is saved to localStorage
- Marketplace items are saved to localStorage
- New items you post are persisted across page refreshes
- Data is stored locally in your browser only

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` folder.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This is a Demo/Prototype**
- Authentication is client-side only (not secure for production)
- No real backend or database
- Data is stored in browser localStorage only
- Messages to sellers are simulated (alerts)
- No real payment processing

## Future Enhancements (For Production)

- Real backend API with database
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Real-time messaging between buyers and sellers
- Image upload functionality
- User profiles and ratings
- Transaction history
- Search optimization
- Mobile app version
- Payment integration
- Admin moderation panel
